# File Operations Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive file library for the Mini Script Language that allows users to open, close, read, and write files with full runtime support.

## Implemented Functions

### Core File Operations
- **`fopen(filename, mode)`** - Opens a file and returns a file handle
  - Supports modes: "r" (read), "w" (write), "a" (append), "r+" (read/write)
  - Returns a file handle that can be used with other file functions
  
- **`fclose(handle)`** - Closes an open file handle
  - Returns 0 on success
  - Properly manages file resources

- **`fread(handle)`** - Reads entire content of file as string
  - Dynamically allocates memory for file content
  - Returns complete file content as string

- **`fwrite(handle, content)`** - Writes string content to file
  - Returns number of bytes written
  - Supports writing arbitrary string content

### Line-Based Operations
- **`freadline(handle)`** - Reads one line from file
  - Automatically removes trailing newlines
  - Returns empty string when end of file is reached

- **`fwriteline(handle, line)`** - Writes one line to file
  - Automatically adds newline character
  - Returns number of characters written

### Utility Functions
- **`fexists(filename)`** - Checks if file exists
  - Returns boolean true/false
  - Safe file existence check

- **`fsize(filename)`** - Gets file size in bytes
  - Returns file size as integer
  - Returns 0 for non-existent files

## Runtime Support

### New Value Type
- Added `TYPE_FILE_HANDLE` to the value type enumeration
- Added `FILE* file_handle` to the Value union structure
- Updated `print_value()` function to display file handles

### Built-in Function Integration
- All file operations are implemented as built-in functions in the interpreter
- Integrated into the same evaluation system as `print()` and `len()`
- Proper error handling for invalid arguments and failed operations

### Memory Management
- Proper allocation and deallocation of string buffers for file content
- Automatic resource cleanup when files are closed
- Safe handling of file pointers and error conditions

## File Library Documentation
Created `lib/file_library.ms` with comprehensive documentation including:
- Function descriptions and parameters
- File mode explanations
- Usage examples
- Best practices

## Test Coverage
Implemented comprehensive test in `tests/test_17_file_operations.ms` covering:
- File creation and writing
- File existence checking
- Reading entire file content
- Line-by-line reading and writing
- Append operations
- Error handling scenarios
- File size operations

## Demonstration Scripts
- `scripts/file_demo.ms` - Practical demonstration of file operations
- Shows real-world usage patterns
- Demonstrates integration with module import system

## Test Results
- **All 17 tests passing (100% success rate)**
- File operations test validates all implemented functionality
- Integration with existing test suite successful

## Key Features
- **Cross-platform file operations** using standard C file I/O
- **Multiple file modes** supported (read, write, append, read/write)
- **Safe error handling** for invalid files and operations
- **Memory efficient** with proper resource management
- **Easy to use API** consistent with Mini Script language design
- **Comprehensive documentation** and examples

## Usage Example
```javascript
// Open file for writing
handle = fopen("data.txt", "w");
fwriteline(handle, "Hello, World!");
fwriteline(handle, "This is line 2");
fclose(handle);

// Read file content
if (fexists("data.txt")) {
    read_handle = fopen("data.txt", "r");
    content = fread(read_handle);
    print("File content:", content);
    fclose(read_handle);
}

// Get file size
size = fsize("data.txt");
print("File size:", size, "bytes");
```

## Implementation Quality
- **Production ready** - All functions properly tested
- **Robust error handling** - Graceful handling of edge cases
- **Well documented** - Clear API documentation and examples
- **Consistent design** - Follows Mini Script language conventions
- **Extensible** - Easy to add additional file operations if needed

The file library implementation successfully extends the Mini Script Language with comprehensive file I/O capabilities while maintaining the language's simplicity and ease of use.
